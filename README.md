# Automated check-in for AU students

Because of the new policy at Aarhus University students need to check into a "Qwickly" system to indicate their presence at lectures, classes etc. This process is incredibly annoying for both students and professors. Therefore I wrote this python programme that does all the work for the student.

## How to run
To run the script download the Check in.py and Check in.csv and put them into the same folder. Open the Check in.csv file and rewrite the XXXs with your login information to the Blackboard system. 
In case you don't have any of the following python packages you will need to download them:
      selenium
      time
      pandas

If you did all the steps above correctly the script should be ready to run.

Enjoy
